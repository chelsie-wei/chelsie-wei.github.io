One of my favorite things to do is listen to & play Renaissance / Baroque / European early music. I wrote about my experience 
with early music in a [newsletter](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1yVaHInbiDgooYWG_iDnGjndPoJv9RLDUdYW_RlO502o/edit?usp=sharing) for Viola da Gamba Society (New England) in 2022. 

Many early music uses ancient musical themes. An example theme in Europe (and later, due to colonization, the Americas) is the tune [Folia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Folia).

Feel free to email me your thoughts!
