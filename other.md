Amazing movies from the theatre, 2025...

*The Fall*, Tarsem, 2006

A recent 4K restoration brought this icon back to the cinema; a movie loved by Roger Ebert, hated by Harvey Scissorhands.

*A Woman Under the Influence*, John Cassavetes, 1974

This was shown at the Harvard Archive's Mother's Day screening. Gena Rowlands was the titular woman, whose mother in the film was portrayed by her own mother in real life, Lady Rowlands. 

*Happy Together*, Wong Kar-wai, 1997

I watched this at Coolidge Corner Theatre with around 400 others in the audience, and I think we were happy together.
