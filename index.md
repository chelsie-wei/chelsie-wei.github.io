## About

<img class="profile-picture" src="headshot.png">

Hi! I am a first-year masters student at Tufts Department of Computer Science ðŸ’». 

Prior to this, I completed my undergraduate studies in [Comparative Literature](https://as.tufts.edu/international-literary-and-visual-studies/about) and [Cognitive & Brain Science](https://as.tufts.edu/psychology/academics/undergraduate-programs/babs-cognitive-and-brain-science) at Tufts, where I focused on human thought and intentionality. 

While there, I worked with EEG and eyetracking at the [Urry Lab](https://sites.tufts.edu/emotiononthebrain/personnel/heatherurry/). My undergraduate thesis, presented at [NeMLA](https://www.nemla.org/content/dam/www/nemla/newsletters/NeMLA_Newsletter_2025_Winter.pdf), explored how literature grapples with *one's duty to think*. 

My focus has since shifted to the study of nonhuman animals, researching the cognitive abilities 
of two African Grey Parrots with [Irene Pepperberg](https://alexfoundation.org/) and [Francesca Cornero](https://www.psychol.cam.ac.uk/staff/francesca-cornero).

You can also find me under the name Ying Ying Wei.
