## About

<img class="profile-picture" src="headshot.png">

Hi! I am a first-year masters student at Tufts Department of Computer Science in Boston, MA. 
Prior to this, I completed my undergraduate studies in Comparative Literature and Cognitive & Brain Science at Tufts, where my learning focused on thought and intentionality. My undergraduate thesis, presented at [NeMLA](https://www.nemla.org/content/dam/www/nemla/newsletters/NeMLA_Newsletter_2025_Winter.pdf), explored how literature grapples with one's duty to think. I also learned about
human brain signals at the [Urry Lab](https://sites.tufts.edu/emotiononthebrain/personnel/heatherurry/).

Now my focus has shifted to nonhuman animals, where I spend a lot of time studying the cognitive abilities 
of two African Grey Parrots with [Dr. Irene Pepperberg](https://alexfoundation.org/).

You can also find me under the name Ying Ying Wei.
